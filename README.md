# nezu-mail

A receive-only catch-all e-mail server designed to give bots the ability to easily receive emails.

## Disclamer

This old project of mine was built to fulfill a specific goal at that time. 
It will eventually get rewritten (probably under a different name) but don't expect me to update or maintain this "legacy" project.
It's being released because "why not".

## Features

- live updating web inbox
- domain whitelist
- API access (undocumented)
- Automatic actions like
  - Delete
  - Discord webhook
  - Generic webhook
  - Find and replace message body

## Bugs and problems

- I don't remember but a lot, I will not be fixing any. Pull requests are **NOT** welcome, so don't waste your time.
